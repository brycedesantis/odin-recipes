        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A fun twist on the classic pizza we all know and love. The use of a baguette allows a family to each get their own individual pizza. A great way to teach young kids how to cook by giving them a chance to make their own pizza at home. It's simple enough that it can be made with as many toppings as desired. It can even be used to make healthy options for those with dietary restrictions.</p>
