        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A chance to enjoy chocolate chip cookies without the need to wait for them to finish baking. Being made without egg means this recipe is safe to consume without the need for baking. With proper storage this cookie dough will remain good for up to 3 months.</p>
        <p>Despite the exclusion of egg the consumption of raw flour remains within the recipe. It is therefore a requirement to heat-treat the flour in the recipe before adding it to the dough. Heat-treatment can be done by way of a microwave or oven, choose whichever option works best for you and enjoy.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>1/2 cup milk chocolate chips</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
